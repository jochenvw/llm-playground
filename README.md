# LLM Playground

Playground where I experiment with applying Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they can improve software engineering.

- [PR-bot](./src/pr-bot/) Bot that pulls sources - finds infra-as-code files, runs prompts and offers suggestions
- [Data-Wrangling](./src/data-wrangling/) Experiments with transforming CSV to JSON - *and* - create transformation script
- [Log-parsing](./src/log-parsing/) Exploring log parsing applications of LLMs
