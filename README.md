# LLM Playground

Playground where I experiment with applying Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they can improve software engineering.

- [PR-bot](./src/pr-bot/) Bot that pulls sources - finds infra-as-code files, runs prompts and offers suggestions
- [Data-Wrangling](./src/data-wrangling/) Experiments with transforming CSV to JSON - *and* - create transformation script
- [Log-parsing](./src/log-parsing/) Exploring log parsing applications of LLMs
- [Team guidance](./src/team-guidance/) Experimenting with LLMs to provide guidance to software development teams **WIP**
- [Log to KQL](./src/log-to-kql/) Experimenting with LLMs to write Kusto Query Language (KQL) against logfiles to automatically extract relevant information a tsv/csv/...whatever log file format **WIP**
