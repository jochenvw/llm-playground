## Find infastructure as code files

Below is a list of file paths (folder and filename). Identify the infrastructure as code (iac) files in this list.

Keep in mind:
- Typically, infrastructure as code files for Azure deployments have the file extension '.bicep' for 'bicep files, or '.json' for ARM templates or .tf for terraform files
- These files are typically stored in folders that indicate they are infrastructure as code files, so folders like 'iac' or 'bicep' are common
- Respond in JSON as instructed
