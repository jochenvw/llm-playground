- All Virtual Machine resources in a development environment should be stopped during non-working hours (leveraging auto-shutdown)

# The current finops guidelines for PRODUCTION environments are:
- All resources in a production environment must be tagged with a `CostCenter` tag with the value `Prod`

Respond as follows:
- if this is NOT an infrastructure as code file - respond with 'NO CHANGE'
- if this is an infrastructure as code file and you do not see any components that violate the finops standards - respond with 'NO CHANGE'
