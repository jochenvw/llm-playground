# Log Parsing

Exploring the log parsing applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Solid application logging is a critical part of any software system. It provides a record of what the system is doing, and it can be used to diagnose problems. However, logs are often difficult to read and understand, especially when they are generated by complex systems. This project explores how LLMs can be used to parse and understand logs, making it easier to diagnose problems and understand what a system is doing.


## Example

Example log (in fact - ChatGPT came up with this example):

```txt
[2024-02-07 15:23:10] [INFO] Application started.
[2024-02-07 15:23:12] [DEBUG] Processing data from input file.
[2024-02-07 15:23:15] [WARNING] Invalid input detected. Skipping record.
[2024-02-07 15:23:18] [ERROR] Failed to connect to database server.
[2024-02-07 15:23:20] [INFO] Processing completed. Results saved to output file.
[2024-02-07 15:23:22] [INFO] Application exiting.
[2024-02-07 15:23:25] [INFO] Incoming HTTP request: GET /api/data
[2024-02-07 15:23:27] [INFO] Processing request for /api/data
```

Sample output:

```
- Problem: Internal server error: 500 - File not found
- Number of occurrences: 4
- Example: [2024-02-07 15:23:35] [ERROR] Internal server error: 500 - File not found
- Suggestion: Check the file path and ensure that the files being requested actually exist on the server. Verify the file permissions and make sure the web server has access to the files.
```

## Findings
I think this can be *very* powerful to summarize logs and provide actionable insights. It can be used to automatically detect and diagnose problems in logs, and provide suggestions for how to fix them. This could be especially useful for large systems with complex logs, where it can be difficult to manually read and understand all of the log messages. This could be a very useful tool for system administrators and developers, and could help to reduce the time and effort required to diagnose and fix problems in complex systems.
